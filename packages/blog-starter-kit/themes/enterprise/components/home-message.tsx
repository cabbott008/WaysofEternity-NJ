        <p className="text-white p-4 font-semibold text-center">Those were the words of the Moravian Missionaries who sold themselves into slavery back in 1732 as they cast off never to be seen again. May our heart be in the same place!</p>

            <p className="text-center text-white">1 Timothy 4:1 says, &quot;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.&quot; This pillar is all about who God actually is, how we relate to Him, and what He expects of us. Let&apos;s not mess this one up!</p>

            <p className="text-center text-white">The family is the basic building block of the Kingdom and Bible Culture. Without strong families built on the foundation of the Word of God, the spiritual energy is drained out of the home. When divine order prevails, synergistic power is released exponentially that transcends family.</p>

            <p className="text-center text-white">Yah is building an assembly that the gates of hell shall not prevail against. Deliverance, healing, finances, signs, and wonders are the birthright of the born again. It is time we stop trusting in the arm of the flesh and live in the power of the Spirit. For in Him we do live, move, and have our being.</p>

            <p className="text-center text-white">Fellowship is not accomplished by being in the same place, listening to the same person. &quot;And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry.&quot; This involves playing active roles!</p>
